# Building and Refining LLM Solutions with Prompt Flow: From Creation to Evaluation


In this demo-heavy session, participants will gain an in-depth understanding of Prompt flow, its latest features, and its application in developing LLM (Large Language Model) solutions. We'll introduce both UI and code-based authoring avenues, catering to varied developer preferences. 
A live demonstration will showcase the process of crafting a RAG-based conversational solution, highlighting the power and flexibility of Prompt flow. Additionally, we'll delve into the creation of custom tools leveraging both LangChain and Semantic Kernel, expanding the horizon of LLM solution possibilities. 
The session will conclude with a hands-on approach to the systematic validation and optimization of LLM solutions, using the dedicated evaluation flows. Join us to explore the comprehensive capabilities of Prompt Flow in the realm of language model solution development.
